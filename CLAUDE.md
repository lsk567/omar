## Development Guidelines

- Every new feature must have a corresponding test in CI.
- After each push, monitor the status of the CI and try to fix the CI failures until they are addressed. If they cannot be addressed after a reasonable number of attempts, update ISSUES.md.
- For every commit, check if any documentation (e.g., README.md) needs to be updated. If so, update them. But leave them alone if there is no need to update.
