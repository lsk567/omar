# OMAR Language Specification

Status: draft  
Implementation language: Lean 4  
Source extension: `.omar`

## 1. Purpose

OMAR is a declarative language for agent systems. A program defines agents,
typed ports, and prompt reactions. The language controls topology startup,
teardown, and mutation. A deterministic runtime coordinates the running system.
AI is used only inside prompt reactions, never for orchestration.

## 2. Syntax

```ebnf
program     = "team", identifier, "(", agents, ")",
              "{", { declaration }, "}" ;

agents      = [ agent, { ",", agent } ] ;
agent       = identifier, ":", identifier ;

declaration = input | output | action | prompt ;
input       = "input", identifier, ":", type ;
output      = "output", identifier, ":", type ;
action      = "action", identifier, [ ":", type ] ;

prompt      = "prompt", identifier, "(", triggers, ")",
              "->", effects, prompt-string ;
triggers    = [ identifier, { ",", identifier } ] ;

effects     = effect, { ",", effect } ;
effect      = atom, [ "?" ]
            | "(", atom, { "|", atom }, ")", [ "?" ] ;
atom        = identifier, [ "=", literal ] ;

type        = "bool" | "int" | "float" | "string" | "path" | "bytes"
            | "list", "<", type, ">"
            | "option", "<", type, ">" ;
```

Identifiers are case-sensitive. `//` starts a line comment and `/* ... */`
delimits a block comment.

### 2.1 Declarations

- `input` is a typed external entry point.
- `output` is a typed externally observable result.
- `action` is a typed internal port.
- An action without a type is a signal carrying no value.
- `prompt agent(a, b)` declares a reaction on `agent` triggered when port `a`
  or port `b` is present. If both are present at the same tag, the reaction is
  invoked once with both values.

The prompt body is delivered to the agent. `$(name)` interpolates a trigger
value and may only reference that prompt's triggers. If a declared trigger is
not present in an invocation, its interpolation expands to `<absent>`.

### 2.2 Effect contracts

The expression after `->` declares the ports a reaction may set:

```omar
-> result
-> result, log?
-> (continue_work | accepted = false)
```

- `a, b` requires both effects.
- `(a | b)` requires exactly one effect.
- `a?` makes an effect optional.
- `a = value` supplies a constant effect.
- A bare typed effect requires the agent to set a value.
- A bare untyped action emits a signal.

Every trigger must be an input or action. Every effect must be an output or
action. Values must match their port types.

## 3. Compiled topology

The compiler produces a canonical topology containing:

```text
team
agents
typed ports
prompt reactions in declaration order
```

There are no dedicated point-to-point channels. The runtime derives a
port-to-reaction subscription index from reaction triggers.

Prompt declaration order is semantically significant. It orders reactions that
may write the same port. Unrelated reactions remain unordered and may run in
parallel.

For each reaction and port, the compiler computes:

```text
mayWrite(reaction, port)
mustWrite(reaction, port)
```

Optional effects and alternatives may write a port but do not necessarily write
it. `mayWrite` determines scheduling conflicts; `mustWrite` determines whether
a reaction is statically guaranteed to replace an earlier value.

## 4. Tagged runtime

The runtime owns one global event queue ordered by logical tag:

```text
tag = (logical_time, microstep)
event = (tag, flow, port, value)
```

An external input creates an event. Effects produced at `(t, m)` are enqueued at
`(t, m + 1)`: the same logical time, next microstep.

At each tag, the runtime:

1. pops all events at that tag;
2. validates and groups values by flow and port;
3. enables prompts with at least one declared trigger present for the flow;
4. builds an invocation dependency DAG;
5. executes the DAG;
6. waits for every invocation at the tag to complete; and
7. atomically enqueues the resulting port values at the next microstep.

The runtime advances only after the global tag barrier closes.

### 4.1 Invocation DAG

Each enabled prompt invocation is a DAG vertex. Add an edge `A -> B` when:

- `A` is declared before `B`; and
- both may write at least one common port.

Invocations assigned to the same non-concurrent agent are also ordered by
declaration order. Since all edges follow declaration order, the DAG is acyclic.

The runtime repeatedly runs all zero-indegree vertices concurrently, waits for
them to complete, removes them, and continues. Every firing order is therefore
a topological ordering of the DAG.

### 4.2 Agent protocol

Topology agents do not address other agents. Each active invocation receives
two scoped MCP tools:

```text
omar_set_port(invocation_id, port, value)
omar_complete(invocation_id)
```

The invocation's trigger map contains only the declared triggers present at
that tag. An absent trigger is omitted, while a present signal has the JSON
value `null`; this preserves the distinction between absence and a signal.

`omar_set_port`:

- only accepts ports listed in the invocation's effect contract;
- validates the value immediately;
- may be called many times; and
- uses last-writer-wins for repeated writes to the same port by that invocation.

Writes remain private until `omar_complete`. Completion validates the final
port snapshot against the contract. Calls after completion are rejected.

If ordered invocations write the same port, the later declared invocation wins
when it actually writes that port. A mandatory effect is guaranteed to replace
the earlier value; an optional effect replaces it only when present.

When every invocation at the tag has completed, final snapshots are committed
in DAG order and routed through the subscription index. Agents send and forget;
the runtime performs all downstream delivery.

## 5. Topology lifecycle

Components have stable IDs derived from their qualified names. A compatible
agent retains its process, context, memory, and active work across topology
updates.

Mutation uses create-before-destroy:

1. verify the installed revision;
2. spawn new agents and install the new topology;
3. atomically activate the new revision;
4. drain obsolete reactions; and
5. kill obsolete agents.

An active invocation finishes against the topology revision on which it began.

## 6. Bytecode

Bytecode describes topology lifecycle. Runtime event coordination is not
encoded as bytecode instructions.

```text
BEGIN_PLAN team

SPAWN_AGENT name backend
KILL_AGENT name

DEFINE_PORT kind name type
REMOVE_PORT name

INSTALL_REACTION id agent triggers effects contract prompt
UPDATE_REACTION id triggers effects contract prompt
REMOVE_REACTION id

ACTIVATE_TOPOLOGY revision
COMMIT_PLAN
ABORT_PLAN reason
```

The initial construction subset consists of `BEGIN_PLAN`, `SPAWN_AGENT`,
`DEFINE_PORT`, `INSTALL_REACTION`, and `COMMIT_PLAN`. Mutation instructions are
reserved for the next implementation stage.

JSON instruction fields are emitted in deterministic order with `op` first.
Reaction fields are ordered:

```text
op, id, agent, triggers, effects, contract, prompt
```

The VM verifies the complete plan before performing effects. Unknown
instructions, invalid references, invalid types, or inconsistent contracts are
errors.

## 7. Lean 4 boundary

The compiler core is pure:

```lean
parse          : String -> Except ParseError Syntax
elaborate      : Syntax -> Except TypeError Topology
compile        : Topology -> Except CompileError Bytecode
verifyBytecode : Bytecode -> Except VerifyError VerifiedBytecode
```

MCP calls, event persistence, scheduling, and process observation belong to the
Rust runtime.

Important verification targets are:

- every trigger and effect references a compatible typed port;
- every per-tag scheduling graph is acyclic;
- bytecode never references an undefined component;
- compatible retained agents are never unnecessarily restarted; and
- equal compiler inputs produce equal bytecode.
